/*
* The weapon info component holds some basic information about the weapon. It holds
* the projectile speed, firing speed, range, damage, and some information to determine when to fire the gun.
* It also holds the type of weapon, which is loaded in AttributeLoaders as an integer.
* 
* In order to load a weapon, first the data is pulled from the appropriate .gdat file into the stateController. After that, the weapon
* is loaded onto the given ship and the textures / model / projectiles are loaded. When fired from the weaponFiringSystem function, a projectile entity
* gets created and added to the scene, and it eventually gets despawned when it hits something or goes out of range. In order to add a new weapon, you'll
* need to add your new attributes file where it defines the basic information and texture/model locations, then any additional behaviors you might want depending
* on the weapon type (i.e., you implemented a new type and need to define how the hell a teapot launcher works) and finally if you've added extra data (or extra components) you'll need
* to add in some extra loading information to the relevant functions in AttributeReaders.cpp (loadWeaponData and loadWeapon).
