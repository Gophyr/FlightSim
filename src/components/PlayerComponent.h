* The player component stores things that are exclusive to the player and get adjusted by the player.
* It stores the camera scene node, which allows the player to actually view the scene, the target scene node,
* which is tied to the IrrlichtComponent of the player ship and updates to allow the camera to rotate,
* and it stores the HUD for the player's ship. 

  The HUD is represented in the hud folder, and includes things derived
* from the base HUD element class. The HUD vector stores all HUD elements, and each HUD element has its own
* update call. Thanks, OOP design!
