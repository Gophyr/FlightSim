* The campaign holds all the data necessary to run the current campaign. The current difficulty acts as a multiplier on how many hostiles there are,
* and the current encounter holds which encounter is happening in the sector (max of four before a large scale battle). It also includes the data for
* how much damage can be repaired to ships and how much ammunition is available.
* 
* Presently, only about half of the data is used, but we're working on it, dammit.
